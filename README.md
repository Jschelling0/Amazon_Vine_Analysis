## Summary

With 47% of all reviews benig 5-stars from non-Vine reviewers, compared to only 36% from Vine reviewers, there is a clear positivity bias towards the non-Vine users. There are also significantly more users who are not part of the Vine progam as well. When looking at the amount of reviews created by both sets of users, it would not be recommended to continue being part of the Vine program. 

One additional source of analyais that could be used to support the statement would be the ability to take a statistical summary of the reviews, seeing what the overall mean is for each reviewer type.
